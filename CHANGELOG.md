# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each entry here should match the `releaseNotes` field in `app/manifest.json`, which is what the
Karoo shows in its own update flow.

## [1.4.1-di2-test1] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- **Di2 - Gears** combines the standard Karoo front- and rear-teeth streams as `36-17`. Missing
  or invalid teeth remain unavailable instead of being reconstructed from gear indices.
- The field reads Ki2's public `FIELD_DI2_UPCOMING_SYNCHRO_SHIFT` value. Ki2 values 1 and 2 use
  BigNum's existing red warning colour; 0 returns to the normal colour. BigNum adds no Shimano,
  direction, timing, prediction, or reset logic.

## [1.4.1-tpms-test3] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- FRONT and REAR now show the existing Karoo red independently when the native pressure alarm is
  enabled and pressure is strictly below `target - range`. The exact limit stays normal; a
  disabled alarm suppresses the warning. The global colour mode still selects number, field fill,
  or no colour, and the confirmed test2 pressure display remains unchanged.

## [1.4.1-tpms-test2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- Native Karoo TPMS values are tenths of a kPa, so the first test build's kPa-to-bar conversion
  showed pressure ten times too high. FRONT and REAR now divide the raw value by 1000 and always
  show two locale-aware decimals, followed by a small separate `bar` line.
- TPMS explicitly opts out of Raised Decimals; its complete value is drawn at one size. The
  native API still exposes no current low-pressure alarm flag, so warning colour remains deferred
  and the debug log now reports raw and converted pressure alongside target, range and alarmEnabled.

## [1.4.1-tpms-test1] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Fork test build with native Karoo **TPMS - Front** and **TPMS - Rear** fields. Both read the
  named tire-pressure value from the multi-value stream and display it in bar. They are
  available as ordinary fields and in **HUD - Two Fields**. This first build assumed the raw
  value was kPa; the hardware-corrected semantics are documented in test2 above.
- Debug builds log changed pressure, target, range and alarm-enabled values for a short
  normal/low/normal K3 capture. karoo-ext 1.1.9 does not expose a current low-pressure alarm
  flag, so this build does not invent a threshold or colour an inferred warning.
- A separate GitHub Actions workflow builds a signed release APK from repository secrets.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **Climb - VAM**, **Climb - VAM Avg** and **Lap - VAM** read 0 on every climb, while the
  Karoo's own VAM field showed 500 to 1100. The Karoo sends these in metres per second rather
  than the metres per hour its documentation promises, and BigNum showed that number as it came.
  They now read in m/h, or ft/h if your elevation is set to imperial, and go negative on a
  descent.
- Distance dropped its decimal once a ride passed 100 km, so 100.6 read as 101. Every distance
  field now keeps the tenth; past 100 the number is drawn slightly smaller so it still fits.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Sunrise** and **Sunset**, under Time & environment. Both read a wall clock in 24-hour form,
  the way Nav - ETA does. The Karoo works the two times out from where you are, so they stay at
  `--` until it has a position fix.

- Twelve more fields, each filling a gap rather than adding a variant for its own sake:
  **Clock** (the plain time of day, which the ETA and the two sun times had left oddly missing),
  **Time - Total** (the whole ride including its stops, against the Time - Riding beside it that
  counts only what was recorded -- the SDK names those two streams the other way round from
  their meanings, so the labels here follow the documentation rather than the constant),
  **Nav - Time to Destination** (how long is left, beside the distance and the arrival clock
  that were already there), **Power - % of FTP** (what HR - % of Max is to heart rate),
  **Lap - Max HR** (the lap group had a maximum for speed, cadence and power but not heart
  rate), **Battery**, and smoothed **Speed** and **Cadence** at 3s, 5s and 10s -- power has
  carried six smoothed variants all along and neither of these had one.

- Each field now also carries a test that it is declared in `extension_info.xml`, which is the
  list the Karoo actually builds its picker from. A field missing there compiles and streams
  and simply never shows up, so the two hand-kept lists had nothing holding them together.

### Changed

- The four wall clocks now preview one moment rather than four unrelated ones: 14:35 on the
  clock, 39 minutes left to run, arriving at 15:14. Nav - ETA's preview was a fixed epoch, so
  it rendered in the device's own zone and read as intended only in UTC.

- The wall clocks raise their minutes, the way a duration raises its seconds: `15:14` draws as
  a large **15** with a small `14`. **Nav - ETA** was drawn whole and the three clocks added
  here followed it, which left every clock-shaped field on a page shrinking its tail except
  those four.

- **The HUD's zone bar becomes a zone pill.** Where a bar filled the whole top of the tile, a
  lozenge now sits in the middle of the row the two labels already occupy, carrying its source's
  icon, one small square per zone with everything up to your current one lit, and the live value.
  Squares rather than a fill, because a zone is a thing you count at a glance on a moving bike.
  **Zone pill style** offers **Solid color** instead, which drops the squares and fills the pill
  with the zone colour. On a field too narrow for two labels and a pill, the labels fall back to
  their icons before the pill gives up its squares; if even that will not fit, the pill hides and
  the labels return. Neither number gives up any height for it, and the pill's source stays the
  separate choice it was.

- Every field's label sits 2px higher and its number is drawn taller. The number was never
  floating in its box -- it already filled every pixel it was given -- so the room came from the
  clearance around it: 2px off the top of the label row, and 5px each off the gap under the label
  and the gap under the number. Measured on a Karoo 3, a 478x180 tile went from 126px of digit to
  135.

- The zone pill's icon, squares and value are all larger. The tallest thing in a 38px pill was
  leaving 8px unused above and below it.

- **Time - Elapsed** is now **Time - Riding**, labelled `RIDE TIME` on the tile instead of
  `TIME`. It is unchanged in what it counts -- time spent recording, stops excluded, which is
  what karoo-ext documents that stream as. Against the Time - Total added beside it, `TIME`
  said nothing about which of the pair dropped the stops. Existing pages keep the field: it is
  stored by id, and the id has not changed.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- On a short tile the HUD's zone bar sat flush against the two numbers, with no gap at all.
  Nothing was clipped -- the digits began one pixel below the bar -- but without air between
  them it read as clipped. The bar now reserves the same inset every other edge of a field
  keeps. Only tiles where the number grows tall enough to reach the bar are affected; on a
  full-height tile nothing changes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **HUD**, one field that shows two others side by side in a single tile. Each half draws a
  whole BigNum field -- its own header, zone colour, grade wedge and typeface -- and the two
  are separated by a hairline. Pick what each half shows in the BigNum app; any of the other
  58 fields will do, the same one twice included. A half whose sensor drops out recovers on
  its own without taking the other half with it.
- **The HUD's zone bar**, an optional row across the top of the tile, filled to where your heart
  rate or power sits on your Karoo zones and coloured with that zone. Pick the source in the
  BigNum app -- any zone-carrying field, so PWR 3s can drive the bar while the halves show
  something else entirely.

  Every zone gets an equal share of the width, so the top of Z3 is three fifths along on any
  rider's scale. The bar names its source with an icon and shows the live value, drawn in
  whatever number font you picked and sized on the digits themselves, so changing the face does
  not change how tall the bar reads. Both the icon and the value flip between black and white as
  the fill passes under them, so they stay legible on the zone colour and on the empty track
  alike.

  With the bar up the two halves drop their labels and keep only their icon, since the bar has
  taken the row the labels were read from. It is laid OVER the tile rather than stacked above it,
  so neither number gives up a pixel unless it would otherwise sit underneath it -- which, with
  numbers pinned to the bottom of their half, is never.

  Turning zone colours off turns the bar off too, on the same reading the grade wedge already
  follows: a rider who wants no colour means everywhere.

### Changed

- The heart rate field's demo value is 141 rather than 145. Test mode and the page editor's
  preview both show the new number.
- The settings screen is grouped into collapsible sections -- Appearance, Global and HUD --
  rather than one flat scroll, and one section is open at a time.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- `minSdk` is 26 rather than 29, so BigNum installs on the Karoo 2. The Karoo 2 runs Android 8.1
  (API 27) and goes no further, and nothing here ever needed API 29 -- `getFont()` and
  `fontVariationSettings`, the newest calls in the renderer, are both API 26. Verified on a
  Karoo 2: the extension connects and the fields render.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **The lap set**, 14 fields: number, time, distance, speed, max speed, heart rate, cadence,
  max cadence, normalized power, max power, W/kg, VAM, ascent and descent, all for the current
  lap.
- **Navigation**, 3 fields: distance to destination, distance to next turn, and ETA. They need
  a route loaded and sit at `--` without one. ETA is a 24-hour wall clock, drawn whole rather
  than with its minutes raised, so it does not read as a stopwatch.

### Changed

- Durations under an hour lose the leading `0:` and are sized against `mm:ss`, so the number is
  drawn taller wherever width is what limits it.
- A value wider than its width template now shrinks only if it is wider than the tile. Where
  height is what limits the number -- most tiles -- a 4-digit power kept a quarter of its height
  for a template it had already outgrown, with room to spare beside it.
- **Power - Lap Avg** is now **Lap - Avg Power**, so it sits with the rest of the lap fields in
  the picker. The field itself is unchanged and pages holding it are not affected.
- Field labels are drawn in capitals and sized against a capital rather than against their own
  ink, so every header has the same letter height and sits on one line. A label with a descender
  ("TIME lap") used to come out a fifth shorter than one without ("HR").

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Font setting.** Numbers are now set in **Saira** by default, with a **Width** (50-124%) and
  **Weight** (100-900) to go with it; **Oswald Bold** is still there for anyone who preferred it.
  Saira's digits are all the same width, so a value no longer shifts sideways as its digits
  change; measured against Oswald over same-length values, that shift reaches 35-45px in the
  widest field. Narrow digits also make the number *taller*: most fields run out of width before
  they run out of height, so at the default width the digits gain roughly 14% on a half-width
  field and a third on **Time - Elapsed** and **Climb - VAM**. Field labels stay in Oswald
  whatever the number is set to, since at 11dp a condensed face loses the space between a label's
  words.
- **Climb - Grade** draws the slope as a coloured wedge behind the number. Its direction follows
  the sign -- rising for a climb, falling for a descent -- and its height and colour follow the
  size, over the same seven bands as the Karoo's own Climber scale, with thresholds at
  2 / 5 / 8 / 11 / 14 / 20%. At 20% the wedge runs corner to corner. Because the wedge cuts
  diagonally across the number, the number and label take a thin contrasting outline rather than
  flipping colour wholesale, which no single threshold could get right.
- Turning zone colouring off now turns the grade wedge off too, on the reading that a rider who
  wants no colour means everywhere.
- **Raised decimals.** A value's decimal, or a ride time's seconds, drawn small and raised --
  34⁹ rather than 34.9, 1:34¹⁷ rather than 1:34:17 -- with the point or colon dropped, because the
  raised digits already say what they are and the separator's width is width the number can have
  instead. On by default, and it replaces the old fixed behaviour where elapsed time raised its
  seconds and nothing else could.
- The settings screen opens with a card in the Karoo's own style saying where to add the fields,
  and scrolls now that there is more on it than fits a 480x800 screen.
- A new icon: the app at icon size, a field card carrying one number with a raised decimal, drawn
  from the bundled Saira's own outlines. The old one was a white square on a white list row,
  which left three black bars floating with nothing around them.

### Changed

- **Time - Elapsed** reads h:mm:ss throughout, so the first hour of a ride shows 0:34:56 rather
  than 34:56 and a clock that has not started reads 0:00:00 rather than a pair of dashes. The
  field is sized against a "0:00:00" template either way, so the leading hour costs no room --
  what it buys is a field that does not change shape the moment the ride passes an hour.
- Each field's bitmap is now rasterised at the size it is displayed at, taken from the view size
  Karoo reports, instead of one fixed size for every tile. Tiles range from 238x142 to 478x288,
  so a single size was drawing about 1.7x more pixels than a half tile can show while stretching
  1.6x on the largest one. Nothing moves on screen; a half-width field allocates and ships 42%
  fewer bytes per update, and the largest tiles stop being upscaled.
- Redundant redraws are dropped. Karoo sends a sample whether or not the value moved, and a
  field whose displayed state is unchanged no longer draws a bitmap or crosses a process
  boundary to say so.

### Notes

- Saira is bundled as the variable `Saira[wdth,wght].ttf` from Google Fonts, subset to Latin so
  the two axes survive without carrying glyphs no field draws. Both it and Oswald are licensed
  under the SIL Open Font License 1.1; see [OFL.txt](OFL.txt).
- A non-finite grade takes the lowest band and the floor wedge height rather than the loudest
  colour and an undefined path.
- The wedge is Grade's alone: every other field takes the same drawing path it always did, and
  the wedge hook defaults to nothing.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Power - W/kg 3s** and **Power - W/kg 5s**. karoo-ext has no smoothed power-to-weight type, so
  these divide the smoothed power stream by the rider weight from the Karoo profile. Without a
  usable weight the field shows `--` rather than raw watts labelled as W/kg.

### Fixed

- A field's fallback value is now rendered through the same conversion as a live one, so a derived
  field cannot print watts where it promises W/kg.
- A non-finite rider weight no longer reaches the screen as `NaN`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-24

First public release.

### Added

- 39 data fields under **BigNum** in the field picker, covering speed, distance, heart rate,
  cadence, power, climbing, time and temperature.
- Numbers rendered in bundled Oswald Bold, sized to fill the field rather than sit at the
  default text size. Each field keeps a constant text size regardless of how many digits its
  current value has; wider values shrink to fit.
- Zone coloring for heart rate and power fields, using the colors the Karoo shows on its own
  Heart Rate Zones and Power Zones settings screens — five zones for heart rate, seven for
  power — with the boundaries taken from the rider's Karoo profile. Three modes:
  - **Off** — every value in the normal text color.
  - **Number** — the number takes the zone color.
  - **Field background** — the field is filled with the zone color and the number, label and
    icon switch to black or white, whichever contrasts better with that fill.
- Elapsed time draws the seconds at half size and raised, so the hours and minutes stay large.
- Metric/imperial follows the Karoo profile for speed, distance, elevation and temperature;
  power-to-weight and TSS use the rider weight and FTP from the same profile.
- Power smoothing offered as separate fields — 3s, 5s, 10s, 30s, 20m, 1hr, lap average and
  normalized power — because karoo-ext gives an extension no per-field settings of its own.
- Light and dark themes, picked up from the Karoo's own setting on every redraw.

### Notes

- A field with no zone, a value of zero, or a profile with no zones configured is drawn in the
  normal text color and never filled.
- The rounded card behind each field is drawn by Karoo. On a ride page it does not clip the
  extension's view to that card, so the fill rounds its own corners to match.
