# karoo-bignum

Large, bold numeric data fields for the Hammerhead Karoo, drawn so the number fills the field
instead of floating in the middle of it. 72 fields covering speed, heart rate, power, cadence,
climbing, laps, navigation and time, with optional heart-rate and power zone coloring driven by
your Karoo `UserProfile`.

Numbers are set in **Saira** by default, with equal-width digits so a value does not shift
sideways as its digits change, and an adjustable width and weight — narrower digits make the
number taller, because most fields run out of width before they run out of height. **Oswald
Bold** remains available in the app's settings, and field labels are set in it whichever number
font you pick.

**Climb - Grade** draws the slope as a coloured wedge behind the number, rising for a climb and
falling for a descent, using the same seven colour bands the Karoo's own Climber scale does. The
wedge reaches corner to corner at 20%.

Built on Hammerhead's [karoo-ext](https://github.com/hammerheadnav/karoo-ext) SDK.

## Screenshots

The same page in each of the three zone coloring modes.

`SPEED`, `GRADE` and `TIME` have no zones, so they stay in the normal text color in every mode.
`GRADE` is showing 22% here to put its wedge at full height; a real road puts it lower.

**Composite** — HUD - Two Fields

The navigation fields need a route loaded; without one they sit at `--`. **Nav - ETA** is a wall
clock in 24-hour form. **Clock**, **Sunrise** and **Sunset** are drawn the same way; the Karoo
works the two sun times out from where you are, so they need a position fix before they read
anything.

**Time - Riding** is the recording clock and stops when the ride does; **Time - Total** runs
from the start of the ride and keeps counting through the stops, so it is the longer of the two
on any ride with a coffee in it.

Speed, distance, elevation and temperature follow the metric/imperial preference from your Karoo
profile. Power-to-weight and TSS use the rider weight and FTP from the same profile.

The Karoo reports plain W/kg itself, but has no smoothed equivalent, so **W/kg 3s** and
**W/kg 5s** are worked out here: smoothed power divided by the rider weight in your profile.
Without a weight to divide by they show `--` rather than a number that would really be watts.

### Durations

The durations — riding and total time, a lap, time to destination — read `h:mm:ss` from one
hour and `m:ss` below it: `4:59`, not `0:04:59`. The width budget follows the shape of the
value, so on the fields where width is the binding constraint the shorter form is drawn
appreciably taller. A running duration steps down a size as it passes the hour; two glyphs of
height for the first hour of every ride is the trade.

The wall clocks — Clock, Sunrise, Sunset and Nav - ETA — hold one width at `h:mm` instead, since
their value cannot outgrow it. They still raise their minutes, so everything shaped like a clock
shrinks its least significant unit and nothing on a page reads as the odd one out.

With **Raised decimals** on, the seconds come out about half size and raised: `1:34:17` reads as
a large **1:34** with a small `17` after it. Hours and minutes are what you read at a glance; the
seconds only need to be present. On a wall clock the same rule takes the minutes: `15:14` reads
as a large **15** with a small `14`.

### Raised decimals

A setting, on by default, that draws the small end of a value small: a decimal, or a duration's
seconds. `34.9` becomes 34⁹, `1:34:17` becomes 1:34¹⁷. The point or colon is dropped, because
raised digits already say what they are and the separator's width is width the number can have
instead.

What that width buys depends on the field. Most fields run out of width before they run out of
height, and there the number comes out taller. Where height is the binding constraint — a wide
tile with a short value — the number stays the same size and simply sits in more room.

### Zone coloring

Heart-rate and power fields can carry their zone as a color, using the same colors your Karoo
shows on its Heart Rate Zones and Power Zones settings screens — five zones for heart rate, seven
for power. The boundaries come from your Karoo profile, so a field agrees with the rest of the
device.

Pick one of three modes in the BigNum app (main menu → BigNum):

- **Off** — every value in the normal text color.
- **Number** — the number itself takes the zone color.
- **Field background** — the whole field is filled with the zone color, and the number, label and
  icon switch to black or white, whichever reads better on that fill.

Fields without a zone, a value of zero, and a profile with no zones configured all stay in the
normal text color and are never filled — an empty field should not sit there in a color that
says something about data it does not have.

### HUD

**HUD - Two Fields** is one tile showing two other fields side by side, each drawn as a whole
BigNum field — its own header, zone color, grade wedge and typeface — with a hairline between
them. Pick what each half shows in the BigNum app; any of the other 72 fields will do, the same
one twice included. A half whose sensor drops out recovers on its own without taking the other
half down with it.

<img src="docs/screenshots/hud.png" width="260" alt="HUD tile with the zone pill: heart rate between the two labels, speed and 3-second power below">

An optional **zone pill** sits in the middle of the tile's top row, between the two labels. It
carries its source's icon, one small square per zone with everything up to your current zone lit,
and the live value. Its source is a separate choice, so `Power - 3s` can drive the pill while the
two halves show something else entirely — above, the pill is heart rate while the halves are speed
and 3-second power.

Squares rather than a filled bar, because a zone is a thing you count at a glance on a moving
bike, where a fill you have to judge against remembered colors is not. **Zone pill style** offers
the other reading: **Solid color** drops the squares and fills the whole pill with the zone color,
which is smaller and quieter if the zone number matters less to you than the value on it.

The two labels stay where they are, one pinned to each outer edge of the tile, so the row reads as
one and the pill has the middle to itself. On a narrow field, where two labels and a pill will not
fit, the labels give way to their icons alone rather than the pill giving up its squares; if even
that leaves no room, the pill hides and the labels come back.

The value is drawn in the same font as every other number — it is a reading, not a caption — and
its height is measured on the digits rather than set as a text size, so it stays put when you
change the face. The pill sits inside the row the labels already occupy, so neither number gives
up any height for it.

Turning zone coloring off turns the pill off too, on the same reading the grade wedge follows: a
rider who wants no color means everywhere. Without zones in your Karoo profile there is nothing to
count towards, so it stays hidden rather than showing squares that never light.

## Installation

### Karoo 3 (Companion app)

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/vmpg/karoo-bignum/releases/latest) in your
   phone's browser.
2. Long-press the `app-release.apk` link and share it with the Hammerhead Companion app.
3. Your Karoo shows an install prompt — press **Install**.

### Karoo 2 (manual sideload)

1. Download `app-release.apk` from the [latest release](https://github.com/vmpg/karoo-bignum/releases/latest).
2. Set up your Karoo for sideloading — DC Rainmaker has a
   [step-by-step guide](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/02/how-to-sideload-android-apps-on-your-hammerhead-karoo-1-karoo-2.html).
3. `adb install app-release.apk`

### Adding fields to a ride profile

On the Karoo: **Settings → Profiles → your profile → Data Pages → pick a page → Add Field →
BigNum → choose a field.**

To update later, long-tap the BigNum icon on the main menu and select **Update**.

## Build from source

```
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Tests:

```
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

## Release signing

Every release has to be signed with the same key, forever: Android refuses to install an update
signed with a different one. Keep the keystore backed up somewhere outside this machine — losing
it means no existing install can ever be updated again.

Create the key once:

```
mkdir -p ~/keys
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore ~/keys/karoo-bignum.jks \
    -alias karoo-bignum -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
```

Then copy `keystore.properties.template` to `keystore.properties` and fill it in. Both the
keystore and that file are gitignored; neither belongs in the repository.

```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

produces a signed `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. Without `keystore.properties`
the same command still works but leaves the APK unsigned, so anyone can build the project without
holding the key.

## Publishing a release

The APK is uploaded by hand, because the signing key never leaves this machine. Everything that
does not need the key is checked by `.github/workflows/release-assets.yml`, which runs when a
release is published.

1. Bump `versionName` and `versionCode` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, `latestVersion`,
   `latestVersionCode` and `releaseNotes` in `app/manifest.json`, and the entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. `./gradlew assembleRelease`, then tag and create the release with `app-release.apk` attached.
3. The workflow checks that the tag, the build file and the manifest all name the same version,
   attaches `app/manifest.json` to the release if it is not already there, and fails the run if
   the APK is missing.

**`manifest.json` has to be ON the release, not just in the repository.** The Karoo's extension
library reads `releases/latest/download/manifest.json`; when that returns 404 the library entry
has no data, so riders cannot open the extension's settings and are offered no update — while the
APK sits there perfectly healthy, which is why it does not look like a release problem. It
happened to v1.3.0 and v1.3.1. The workflow exists to make it unrepeatable, but if you ever
publish without it, check the URL yourself.
