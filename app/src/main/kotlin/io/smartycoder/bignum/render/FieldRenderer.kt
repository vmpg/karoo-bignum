 * the rider picked, and pushes it into the RemoteViews via setImageViewBitmap.
 * Unit suffixes (km/h, W, ...) are intentionally not drawn unless a field explicitly requests
 * the small separate line below the value.
 *
 * The header is ours rather than Karoo's: the field sends UpdateGraphicConfig(showHeader =
 * false), which buys the whole tile and lets the label be a short form ("PWR 5s") instead of
 * Karoo's uppercased displayName ("POWER 5S AVG"). The label is always Oswald -- see
 * [LABEL_FONT] -- so only the number follows the rider's choice.
 *
 * Neither bitmap is sized to [ViewConfig.viewSize]: on the Karoo the reported view size does
 * not match the actual ImageView, so anything measured against it gets rescaled away or
 * clipped. The number is a tight, fixed-aspect box that a fit* scaleType blows up to fill the
 * real view; the header is drawn at its natural size into a wrap_content view. Both are
 * pinned to the edge [ViewConfig.alignment] asks for by the layout, not by padding baked
 * into the bitmap.
